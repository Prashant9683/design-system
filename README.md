# HOMEZY DESIGN SYSTEM

# Commnands

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:



## API Reference



```http
  npm start # or yarn start
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `npm start` | `script` | **execute the defined file without typing its execution command.**.|


This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you
save inside `src`causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either storybook or the example playground:

## Storybook

Run inside another terminal:
```http
  yarn storybook
```

This loads the story from `./stories`.
